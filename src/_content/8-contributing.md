>You can be part of our adventure

You can run Vizabi source code on your machine, and contribute to the development of tools or the framework.

Here are some of the things we would love to improve:

- Development of awesome visualization tools
- Improvement of QA and testing routines
- More readers that support various data formats
- More buttons and UI controls
- Offline support
